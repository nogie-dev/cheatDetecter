- **Comprehensive Logging**: Records detailed information about cheating attempts including:
  - Username of the person who originally solved the challenge
  - Username of the person who used the shared flag
  - Team information for both users
  - IP address of the cheating attempt
  - Timestamp of the incident
  - Reason for the detection

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Clone or Download**: Place the `cheatDetecter` folder in your CTFd `plugins` directory:
   ```
   CTFd/plugins/cheatDetecter/
   ```

2. **Database Migration**: The plugin will automatically create the necessary database tables when CTFd starts.

3. **Restart CTFd**: Restart your CTFd instance to load the plugin.

## üìã Requirements

- CTFd 3.0.0 or higher
- Python 3.7+
- Flask-SQLAlchemy
- Admin privileges for dashboard access

## üîß Configuration

The plugin is configured through `config.json`:

```json
{
    "name": "cheatDetector",
    "route": "/detecter/dashboard"
}
```

## üéÆ Usage

### For Administrators

1. **Access Dashboard**: Navigate to `/detecter/dashboard` in your CTFd admin panel
2. **View Cheating Attempts**: The dashboard displays all detected cheating attempts in a table format
3. **Filter Data**: Use the filter dropdowns to search by specific users or reasons
4. **API Access**: Use `/detecter/api/cheat_data` endpoint to programmatically access cheat detection data

### Dashboard Features

- **Real-time Updates**: Data is fetched via AJAX for real-time updates
- **Filtering**: Filter by username or cheating reason
- **Timestamp Formatting**: Human-readable timestamps for all incidents
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

### API Endpoints

#### GET `/detecter/api/cheat_data`
Returns JSON data of all cheating attempts:

```json
[
    {
        "shared_username": "user_who_used_flag",
        "sharer_username": "user_who_solved_challenge",
        "shared_team": "team_of_user_who_used_flag",
        "sharer_team": "team_of_user_who_solved_challenge",
        "cheat_ip": "192.168.1.100",
        "timestamp": 1640995200,
        "reason": "Cross Team Flag Sharing"
    }
]
```

## üîç How It Works

### Detection Algorithm

1. **Flag Submission**: When a user submits a flag, the plugin intercepts the submission
2. **Database Lookup**: Checks if the submitted flag exists in the `DynamicFlag` table
3. **User Comparison**: Compares the current user with the original solver
4. **Team Verification**: In team mode, verifies if users belong to different teams
5. **Cheat Logging**: If cheating is detected, logs the incident and blocks the submission

### Database Schema

#### DynamicFlag Table
- `id`: Primary key
- `created_flag`: The flag that was generated
- `container_id`: Associated container ID (for container-based challenges)
- `challenge_id`: Challenge ID
- `team_id`: Team ID (nullable for individual mode)
- `user_id`: User ID of the original solver
- `user_ip`: IP address of the original solver

#### cheatList Table
- `id`: Primary key
- `shared_username`: Username of the person who used the shared flag
- `sharer_username`: Username of the person who originally solved the challenge
- `shared_team`: Team name of the person who used the shared flag
- `sharer_team`: Team name of the person who originally solved the challenge
- `cheat_ip`: IP address of the cheating attempt
- `timestamp`: Unix timestamp of the incident
- `reason`: Description of the cheating type

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

- **IP Tracking**: Records IP addresses for both original solvers and cheating attempts
- **Team Isolation**: Prevents cross-team flag sharing in team competitions
- **Individual Protection**: Detects flag sharing in individual competitions
- **Admin-only Access**: Dashboard and API access restricted to administrators
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all cheating attempts for investigation

## üîß Integration with Other Plugins

The cheatDetecter plugin integrates seamlessly with:
- **Container Plugin**: Works with dynamic flags generated by container-based challenges
- **Dynamic Challenges Plugin**: Compatible with dynamic challenge types
- **Team Management**: Supports both individual and team competition modes

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Plugin Not Loading**: Ensure the plugin folder is in the correct location and CTFd has been restarted
2. **Dashboard Not Accessible**: Verify you have admin privileges
3. **Database Errors**: Check that CTFd has proper database permissions
4. **False Positives**: Review the detection logic if legitimate flag sharing is being flagged

### Debug Mode

Enable CTFd debug mode to see detailed plugin loading information:
```python
# In CTFd config
DEBUG = True
```

## üèóÔ∏è Using Dynamic Flags in Challenge Containers (Pwn/Web)

You can use this plugin to generate dynamic flags for each user/team and inject them into your challenge containers as environment variables. This is especially useful for pwn and web challenges.

### Workflow Overview
1. **Dynamic Flag Generation**: When a user/team starts a challenge, a unique flag is generated and stored in the database (DynamicFlag table).
2. **Container Launch**: When the challenge container is created (e.g., via Docker), the generated flag is passed as an environment variable.
3. **Challenge Code**: The challenge service (pwn/web) loads the flag from the environment variable and uses it for flag validation.

### Example: Dockerfile for Challenge Container

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20.04
# ... other setup ...

# Set the flag from the environment variable when the container starts
ENV FLAG=CTF{dummy_flag}

# (Optional) Use an entrypoint script to inject the flag at runtime
COPY run.sh /run.sh
RUN chmod +x /run.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["/run.sh"]
```

### Example: run.sh Entrypoint Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Start your service, passing the flag from the environment
export FLAG=${FLAG}
exec /your/challenge/binary_or_server
```

### Example: Challenge Code (Python)

```python
import os
FLAG = os.environ.get('FLAG', 'CTF{dummy_flag}')
# Use FLAG in your challenge logic
```

### How to Connect the Dynamic Flag
- When launching the container for a user/team, retrieve the generated flag from the CTFd database (DynamicFlag table) and pass it as the `FLAG` environment variable:
  - Example (docker run):
    ```bash
    docker run -d -e FLAG=<generated_flag> ... your_challenge_image
    ```
- Your challenge code should always read the flag from the environment variable, not hardcode it.

### Integration with CTFd
- If you use an orchestration system or script to launch containers, make sure it queries the plugin/database for the correct flag and injects it as shown above.
- This ensures each user/team gets a unique flag, and the plugin can track and detect any flag sharing or cheating attempts.
